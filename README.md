# 🎬 Movie Sentiment Analysis

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes movie reviews to determine whether they express **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments.  
This project uses Python, machine learning models, and text-processing techniques to extract insights from movie review datasets.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/movie-sentiment-analysis.git
cd movie-sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "movie sentimental analysis.ipynb"
Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying movie sentiments.

Visualizations include word clouds for positive and negative reviews.

The confusion matrix and metrics help evaluate the model’s performance.

💡 Future Improvements

Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for better accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.

Expand dataset for multilingual sentiment detection.
